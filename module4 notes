Canary

appv1 -->5 ec2 vm

appv2-->1 appv1 + 4appv2

Canary is the upgrade process of application

app v1-->100 ec2 vm :amazon.in

new upgrade appv2

appv1-->appv2

if you upgrade all v1 to v2, you find v2 is not at all working??

It will cause application downtime, appv2.

To safeguard this kind of failure, what org does they use different type upgrade


blue/green:

app v1--100 ec2 vm
app v2-->100 more ec2 vm =200

I will send the traffic to both the appv1 and appv2
 increasing the cost.


canary: 70-30
appv1 :100 ec2 vm
appv1: 70, rest 30 ec2 vm will upgrade to appv2

70 app v1 30 app v2=100
