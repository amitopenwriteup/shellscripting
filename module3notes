notes for devops
Devops:

Linux (basic command of Linux)
vi/nano/vim editor ( How to insert code,how to save, not save)

-----------------------
1) DC : 80-90% os is Linux based
2) Linux is opensource tool: git,jenkins,docker,kubernetes, ansible, terraform..developed on Linux

They can work on windows as well

SDLC: Software development life cycle:

It shows complete phase of software from planning to development.

Requirement: problem which user facing/competition

Samsung/iPhone

Planning: what we can develop /what we cannot
--Feasibility: budget, skill,strength,time

coding-->testing-->release -->deployment

--------------------
Waterfall model
agile 
devops
Lot of tools knowledge is required
git/GitHub
jenkins--> gitlabci/GitHub action/ aws code build/commit/

basic coding skill: shell/python

-->new product
-->bug fixes (issue, security issue)
pakage
---------------------
Operation--code 

dev-->Write code-->package

Ops-->apply the code in prod-->

Plan when to apply


raw material code-->Restrant====>final food that is pacakge



Devops: where journey start with code change and end with code deployment


-->when developer make the code changes--> end when operation apply the code change


Dev-->who thinks that they are doing everything right, 
a
b
c
d
e
f


Ops:-->which thinks that developer are not addressing the issues
a
b
keep env up and run

21/01(notes)

laptop: windows 10--upgrade to windows 11

After upgrading my system  is not working..

you can not use your laptop
--------------------

DC-->upgrad application-->application is not working

it is going to give huge impact
--------------------
Blue green

i will have two laptops which is running windows 10

one env i will upgrad to win11, second laptop i will keep win 10

-------------------------------


git : QA, DEV, DEVOPS

To manage the code

git ,GitHub, clone,pull,push,add.......


---------------------
Jenkins/GitHub action/GitlabCI/Azure devops/Aws code build/Aws code deploy


code-->you will write code(which will perform all activity)-->final prod

pack-->testing-->releasign--

CICD-->Continuous integration continuous deployment/delivery

To implement the devops methodology we need to write the code, that code will perform activity which is called cicd
---------------------------
49 developer there who is writing one application

Amit-->he will working in his dev box, writing one code feature (abc)

Arun-->dev, he is also working in his dev box, writing code for another feature (def)


ABC+DEF ==Code integration-->continuous integration

dev code changes will be intergration at a centralized repo, from there the process of cicd will start.

Retro-->veg

CI-->code will updated on the centralized repo(remote repo) from where Jenkins (Cicd tool) will pick the code and create the package,test and release.

From release part if the package has deployed in production env and monitor it is called CD.

--------------------------------------
In many cases, package is not deployed immediately production, they release the package to the staging site, the CD ..D part will delivery


Playstore--> update is available for app (WhatsApp)

Did playstore automatically update it, did it prompt and you weather you want to update or not??

IT will prompt..

WhatsApp package, it goes for update,then application will not be accessible during that update process.

--------------
PRoduction env, we don;t deploy directly.

we raise a change window, that you will inform the users, that 12o'clock to 2 o'clock we have maintaenace window.

irctc/ citi/sbi (weekend, in the midnight)

irctc: cannot go and raise change window moring 10 am.

night 12 o'clock.
