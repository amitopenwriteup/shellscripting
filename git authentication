git and GitHub

Git is version control system.

we have created the git repo: To create a git repo which command we will use?

git init--> .git(subdirectory)

Local git repo (which you will create on your development box)

Remote git repo (which will be shared across multiple developers, which you create on GitHub)


-->If I create a file, I want to staged that file for commit-> git add

--> We create the commit: git commit -m "Add"

-->commit id (Version id)-->track the code changes

--------------
we have created a remote git repo on the GitHub.

we have mapped it using ssh authentication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

What is git clone?

Go and create a EC2 instance (ubuntu)


You join a development team,they are already having project on GitHub.

They will give you Linux box.

sshurl: git@github.com:amitopenwriteup/mystartraining.git

Private key (deleted ec2 instance)-->private key also deletes


---------------------------------------
how many types of authentication git supports?

https(username and pat) and ssh (public-private key pair)

how will you identify which auth I need to use?

by url

If url of git clone is starting with https (Then it https based auth)

If url is starting with (git@github.com) then it is ssh base auth


Why password are not used why PAT?
When you are configuring PAT: expiry duration +authorization
